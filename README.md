## Experimental code
----------------------

### Setup
The software is configured in Linux. Before running the experimental code, please run the following commands in bash:

```Bash
>>> cd source
>>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

We use some publicly open-source code to aid in our experiments. Some scripts in the folder `source` are downloaded from https://github.com/nla-group/fABBA and https://github.com/nla-group/ABBA.Â 


### Data

The data from the UCR Archive and the UEA Archive can be downloaded from https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/index.php; other data are contained in this repo.


### Experiments

The results of Table 2 and Figure 1 can be reproduced by running ``demo.ipynb``

The results of Figure 3 can be reproduced by running ``quantize_err.ipynb``

The results of Figures 4 and 5 can be reproduced by first running ``multithreading.ipynb``, and then the figures are generated via running ``mthread_results.ipynb``

The results of Figures 6 and 7 can be reproduced by ``UCRPP1.ipynb`` and ``UCRPP2.ipynb``, and then the figures are generated via running ``run_variants_profiles.ipynb``

The results of Figures 8, 9, and 10 simulated via ``qabba_uea_0.001.ipynb``, ``qabba_uea_0.01.ipynb``, corresponding to the figures generated by ``results1.ipynb`` and ``results1.ipynb``, respectively. 

All code output can be found in the folder ``results`` and ``figs``.
